Gnuplot is a command-line program that can generate two- and three-dimensional plots

graphics as well as education. The program runs on all major computers and operating
systems (GNU/Linux, Unix, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and others). It is a program
with a fairly long history, dating back to 1986. Despite its name, this software is 
not distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), opting for its own more
